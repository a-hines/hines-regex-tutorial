# Hines Regex Tutorial
The purpose of this assignment is to breakdown and discuss a chosen regular expression. A regular expression, known as a regex, is a set of characters used to specify a search patter. Regex are useful for a variety of puposes across almost all programming languages. 

### Summary
Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components
### Anchors
Anchors are used to assert something about a string or the matching process. They do not align to any characters. 

### Quantifiers
Quanitfiers 'quantify' how many of something (character, group, character class) must be in the input for a match to be found. 

### OR Operator
The OR operator | is used to match an option on either side of the operator while capturing both options. 

### Character Classes
Character classes are used to tell the regex engine to match only one out of multiple characters.

### Flags
Flags are used to affect what is returned in the search. 

### Grouping and Capturing
Groups is used to group multiple patters. Groups can be captured where multiple instances of a pattern will be displayed in an array. 

### Bracket Expressions
The OR operator [] is similar to the OR operator but does not capture the options. 

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy quatifiers will match the longest possible string while lazy quatifiers will match the shortest possible string. 

### Boundaries
Boundary markers anchor the pattern to the beginning and end of a line.

### Back-references
Backreferences indenfiy a previously matched group and looks for the same match again. 

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind, which together are called look-around, tell if a match is possible or not.
